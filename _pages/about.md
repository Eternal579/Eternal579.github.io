I'm excited about enhancing the security, reliability, and performance of current systems **(Cloud Network System, ML System)** 
through software modification (eBPF, framework update) or by leveraging emerging hardware (programmable switch, DPU).

I'm now working with [Prof.Zhang](https://zhangmenghao.github.io/). After completing prototype [Themis](https://github.com/Eternal579/Themis) ([Paper here](http://bugeater.space/files/sosp24poster_Themis.pdf)), I'm now working on implementing it on a Tofino Switch.
