I'm excited about network system, with a particular focus on **RDMA network protocol** and the safety&performance brought by **programmable switches, DPU.**
I'm now working with [Prof.Zhang](https://zhangmenghao.github.io/). After completing prototype [Themis](https://github.com/Eternal579/Themis) ([Paper here](http://bugeater.space/files/sosp24poster_Themis.pdf)), I'm now working on implementing it on a Tofino Switch.
